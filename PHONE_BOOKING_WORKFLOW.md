### **Tip 3: Three Workflow Options**

**A. Immediate Entry (Best)**
```
Phone rings → Book appointment → Ask for email
→ While still on call OR right after hanging up
→ Open /admin/send-review on phone
→ Enter info (30 seconds)
→ Submit
→ Move on to next call

Pros: Never forget, most accurate
Cons: Requires discipline during/after each call
```

**B. End-of-Day Batch (Good)**
```
Throughout day → Take quick notes (name, email, date)
→ End of day (5 PM)
→ Open /admin/send-review
→ Enter all clients at once (2-3 minutes for 5 clients)
→ Done for the day

Pros: Batch process, less interruption
Cons: Might forget details, need note-taking system
```

**C. After Each Appointment (Also Good)**
```
Complete appointment → Client leaves
→ Before packing up, pull out phone
→ Open /admin/send-review
→ Enter client info (30 seconds)
→ Pack up and leave

Pros: Fresh in memory, natural workflow
Cons: Need to remember after each appointment
```

**Recommended: Mix of A and C**
- **Phone bookings:** Enter immediately (Option A)
- **In-person appointments:** Enter right after (Option C)

You: "Perfect! I'm available Friday. What time works for you?"
Client: "2 PM?"
You: "Great, I have you down for Friday at 2 PM. What's the best
      email to send you a confirmation?"
Client: "john@example.com"
You: "Perfect, you'll receive a confirmation shortly."
```

**Feels professional, client expects it**

### **During Appointment (Good):**
```
You: "All set! By the way, what's your email? I like to send a
      confirmation for my records."
Client: "john@example.com"
You: "Great, thanks!"

[After leaving, enter in form]
```

### **Via Text After Appointment (OK):**
```
You: "Thanks again for your business! Could you reply with your
      email so I can send you a receipt?"
Client: "john@example.com"
You: "Perfect, sending now!"

[Enter in form]

## ⚡ Speed Hacks

### **Hack 1: Voice Typing**
On phone, use voice-to-text:
- Tap name field → microphone icon
- Say: "John Doe"
- Tap email field → microphone icon
- Say: "john at example dot com"
- Submit

**Time: 15 seconds instead of 30**

### **Hack 2: Email Pattern Recognition**
Many clients:
- firstlast@gmail.com
- first.last@company.com

Ask once, type fast.

### **Hack 3: Tab Key (Desktop)**
If on desktop:
- Tab moves to next field
- Enter submits form
- Keyboard only, super fast

### **Hack 4: Browser Autofill**
Save common domains:
- @gmail.com
- @yahoo.com
- @hotmail.com

Type "john" → browser suggests "john@gmail.com"
